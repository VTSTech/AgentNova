AgentNova Plugin System v0.1

Provides a directory-scan-based plugin architecture for extending AgentNova
with backends, CLI commands, configuration, and feature hooks.

Plugins are discovered from ``agentnova/plugins/`` directories that contain
a ``plugin.json`` manifest.  Each plugin exposes ``register()`` and
``unregister()`` entrypoints that the PluginManager calls during lifecycle.

Core (native) backends -- ollama and llama-server -- are never treated as
plugins; they ship inside ``agentnova/backends/`` and are always available.

Usage::

    from agentnova.plugins import get_plugin_manager

    pm = get_plugin_manager()
    pm.load_all()

    # Backends registered by plugins are available via the normal path
    from agentnova.backends import get_backend
    backend = get_backend("bitnet")
