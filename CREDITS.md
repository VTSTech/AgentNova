## Architectural Inspirations

AgentNova draws design philosophy and patterns from several influential projects and research.

### OpenClaw

AgentNova was **inspired by the architecture of OpenClaw**, rebuilt from scratch for local-first operation. The original OpenClaw project served as the conceptual foundation upon which AgentNova was designed, with a focus on stripping away cloud dependencies and enabling fully local agentic workflows.

### ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

The core agentic loop in AgentNova implements the **ReAct paradigm** — a framework where language models interleave reasoning traces (Thought) with action execution (Action/Action Input), observe results (Observation), and produce final answers. This pattern, introduced in the paper *"ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models"* (Yao et al., 2022), is the backbone of how AgentNova orchestrates tool-calling with models that lack native function calling support. The unified ReAct prompting system, enhanced observation formatting, and few-shot examples for small models all stem from this research.

### ATLAS-Autonomous

The **retry-with-error-feedback** feature introduced in R04.1 was inspired by the [ATLAS-Autonomous](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS) benchmark infrastructure. The ATLAS project demonstrated that giving models a chance to correct failed tool calls before the agent gives up significantly improves success rates on error-prone tasks. AgentNova adopted this concept, implementing it as configurable retry context injection that works across both native tool-calling and ReAct text-based paths.

## Development History

AgentNova's origins are a testament to the power of rapid, iterative AI-assisted development — or as the kids call it, **vibe coding**.

### LocalClaw Era — Vibe Coding with DeepSeek and Gemini

The project began life as **LocalClaw**, a local-first reimagining of the OpenClaw agentic framework. In its earliest iterations, LocalClaw was written through an unconventional development workflow: **vibe coding sessions** with **DeepSeek** and **Google Gemini** acting as pair-programming assistants. Rather than writing detailed specifications and planning documents first, the approach was conversational and exploratory — describing the desired behavior in natural language, iterating rapidly on generated code, and refining through hands-on testing against real local models running on Ollama.

This vibe coding process proved remarkably effective for a project of this nature. The agentic loop, tool-calling infrastructure, ReAct prompt parsing, security layer, and multi-backend architecture all emerged from these freeform coding sessions. DeepSeek excelled at generating the initial scaffolding and handling the more complex algorithmic components like the tool parser and error recovery system, while Gemini contributed to architectural decisions, the spec compliance layer, and the soul/skills system design. The result was a working agentic framework that, despite its unconventional genesis, maintained clean code quality, comprehensive test coverage, and strong architectural principles throughout.

### The Pivot to AgentNova R00 — GLM-5 and Super-Z

By the time the project reached its **R00 release milestone** and was renamed from LocalClaw to **AgentNova**, the development workflow shifted exclusively to **GLM-5** and its agentic platform persona, **Super-Z**. This transition marked a significant evolution in both the project's identity and its development methodology. Where the earlier vibe coding sessions were exploratory and multi-model, the AgentNova era brought a focused, sustained development relationship with a single AI pair-programmer that understood the full project context, architectural decisions, and design philosophy.

Under the GLM-5/Super-Z collaboration, the project underwent substantial maturation: the OpenResponses specification was implemented with full compliance, the ACP integration reached v1.0.5, the Soul Spec v0.5 persona system was designed and shipped, the AgentSkills packaging format was defined, and the multi-agent orchestrator with router, pipeline, and parallel modes was built out. The comprehensive test suite — spanning reasoning benchmarks, tool-calling validation, security audits, and spec compliance checks — was also largely developed and maintained through this partnership.

The progression from LocalClaw's freewheeling vibe coding origins to AgentNova's disciplined development under GLM-5 demonstrates that AI-assisted development can scale from rapid prototyping to production-grade software engineering. The entire codebase — thousands of lines of carefully structured Python with zero external dependencies, 600+ tests, and multi-spec compliance — stands as evidence that vibe coding is not just a meme but a legitimate and powerful development methodology when paired with the right AI collaborator.

## Model Creators & Supported Models

AgentNova is optimized to run efficiently on small, local LLMs. The framework includes family-specific configurations (prompting style, stop tokens, tool format, temperature defaults, thinking mode handling) for the following model families and their creators.

### Alibaba Cloud — Qwen Series

The **Qwen** family from Alibaba Cloud is the most extensively configured and tested model family in AgentNova. Multiple model sizes and variants are supported with native tool calling.

## APIs & Web Services

### DuckDuckGo — Web Search

The built-in `web_search` tool uses **DuckDuckGo Lite** (`https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite/`) as its primary search endpoint, falling back to **DuckDuckGo HTML** (`https://html.duckduckgo.com/html/`) when Lite returns no results. This provides free, API-key-free web search capability directly from the command line or agent workflow.

### OpenAI Chat Completions API

AgentNova implements the **OpenAI Chat Completions API** format through Ollama's `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. This enables integration with any tool or middleware that expects the OpenAI request/response format, including `tool_choice`, `response_format`, `logprobs`, `stop`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, `top_p`, and `n` parameters.

### Ollama API

AgentNova communicates with Ollama through two API endpoints:

- **`/api/chat`** — Ollama's native chat API (OpenResponses mode). Supports native tool calling, model listing (`/api/tags`), model inspection (`/api/show`), and streaming.
- **`/v1/chat/completions`** — OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Chat Completions mode). Supports SSE streaming, tool calling, and the full OpenAI parameter set.

### llama-server / TurboQuant API

The llama-server backend (including TurboQuant builds) communicates through two endpoints:

- **`/completion`** — llama.cpp native text completion API with `prompt`, `n_predict`, `temperature`, `stop`, and `cache_type_k`/`cache_type_v` (TurboQuant KV compression) parameters. Used in OpenRE mode with ReAct tool parsing.
- **`/v1/chat/completions`** — OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Chat Completions mode). Supports SSE streaming, tool calling, and the full OpenAI parameter set.
- **`/v1/models`** — Model listing endpoint. Falls back to `/props` (llama.cpp native) for model name discovery when `/v1/models` returns nothing useful.
- **`/health`** — Health check endpoint used for readiness polling and server status.

### BitNet API

The BitNet backend communicates through a simple completion endpoint:

- **`/completion`** — Text completion API with `prompt`, `n_predict`, `temperature`, and `stop` parameters. No native tool calling support — AgentNova uses ReAct text parsing.

## Benchmarks & Evaluation Frameworks

AgentNova's test suite draws on and adapts questions from established evaluation benchmarks to measure reasoning, tool-calling, and knowledge capabilities.

| Benchmark | Source | Usage in AgentNova |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| **GSM8K** | [Cobbe et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14168) | 50 math word problems adapted for calculator tool-calling evaluation (`test 04_gsm8k_benchmark`) |
| **BIG-bench** | [Srivastava et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09261) | Common sense reasoning (25 Q), causal reasoning (25 Q), logical deduction (25 Q), general knowledge (25 Q), and implicit reasoning (25 Q) questions adapted for local LLM evaluation |
| **BIG-bench Hard (BBH)** | [Suzgun et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09261) | Reasoning test structure (14 Q across 8 categories: logical deduction, common sense, multi-step, pattern, counter-intuitive, spatial, causal, comparative) |

## Development Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Link |
|------|---------|------|
| **pytest** | Unit testing framework (`tests/` directory with 600+ tests covering skills, security, builtins, spec compliance, and agent behavior) | [https://pytest.org](https://pytest.org) |
| **black** | Opinionated Python code formatter (line-length: 100, target: Python 3.9-3.12) | [https://github.com/psf/black](https://github.com/psf/black) |
| **ruff** | Fast Python linter (rules: E, F, W, I) | [https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) |
| **setuptools** | Build system and package distribution | [https://setuptools.pypa.io](https://setuptools.pypa.io) |

## Python Standard Library

AgentNova proudly uses **zero external dependencies** at runtime. The entire framework — HTTP requests, JSON parsing, tool execution, security validation, streaming, and all backend communication — relies exclusively on the Python standard library (`urllib`, `json`, `subprocess`, `math`, `datetime`, `re`, `os`, `pathlib`, `time`, `uuid`, `collections`, `itertools`, `zoneinfo`, `platform`). This design choice ensures maximum portability, minimal attack surface, and ease of installation.
